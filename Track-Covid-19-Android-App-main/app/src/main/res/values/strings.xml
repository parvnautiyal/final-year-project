    <string name="spread">COVID-19 spreads mainly by droplets produced as a result of coughing or sneezing of a COVID-19 infected person. This can happen in two ways:\n <b>Direct close contact:</b> one can get the infection by being in close contact with COVID-19 patients (within one Metre of the infected person), especially if they do not cover their face when coughing or sneezing.\n <b>Indirect contact:</b> the droplets survive on surfaces and clothes for many days. Therefore,
touching any such infected surface or cloth and then touching oneâ€™s mouth, nose or eyes
can transmit the disease.</string>
